# My Github Folder of all my Projects

This is a folder that contains all of the projects that I worked on During my Summer Vactaion of 2024 directly from Visual Studio Code.

1. Weather App 🌦️
A simple and elegant weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display real-time weather information for any city in the world. Users can search for their desired city and view temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a description of the current weather conditions.

Features 🚀
Search for Cities: Enter a city name to get the latest weather details.
Live Weather Updates: Real-time data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Dynamic UI Updates: Updates the UI with the city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
Responsive Design: Adaptable design for desktop and mobile viewing.
